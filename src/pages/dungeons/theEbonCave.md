- A small brazier providing additional warmth and light.

## Residents

  - A male Orc wielding a greatsword.
  - Occasionally paces the cave, inspecting his domain and giving orders.
2. 5 Other Bandits
  - Two of them are archers, equipped with bows and light armor.
  - One is a former soldier, skilled with a sword and shield.
  - Another is a nimble thief, adept at sneaking and picking locks.
  - The fifth is a burly brute, favoring a massive warhammer.

## Activity
- The bandit leader stays in the cave in his chamber most of the time.
- Three bandits leave the cave for robbery in the morning, the other two in the evening.
- When not on raids, the bandits can be found gambling, sparring, or tending to their gear.
- At night, the cave is filled with the sounds of laughter, argument, and occasional brawls.
