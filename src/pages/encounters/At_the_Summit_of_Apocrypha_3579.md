## Stages

### 10
We are at the arena located at the Black Book "Waking Dreams" Chapter VI: "Bending the Will of Sahrotaar, First and Last and Always".

After learning the "Bend Will" Thu'um, Dovahkiin comes to Miraak's temple, aiming at ending Miraak's evil deed to Solstheim one thing for all. An epic battle is imminent between Dovahkiin and Miraak. Hermaeus Mora, on the other hand, remains neutral, commenting on this battle as it progresses.

### 20 - Boss Phase 1
(The "Fus Ro Dah" shout was thrown at Miraak.) The battle has been ignited.

In this phase, Miraak fights by casting destruction spells. The most frequently used one is the Venom Spikes spell. He also casts giant fireballs and lightning strikes.

### 40 - Boss Phase 2
To turn the tides, Miraak summons a dragon. He sacrificed the dragon right after, absorbing its soul. This greatly strengthens his power. He casts spells more frequently and destructively. To make things even more difficult for his opponent, Miraak also activates the Dragon Aspect shout, granting him an almost unpenetrable armor protection. He seems invincible now.

### 100 - 🙌
Miraak has been defeated. Dovahkiin decides to make him pay for his sins with life. Miraak flees to the arena exit and tries to escape, but he is caught by Hermaeus Mora. Hermaeus Mora claims to be ashamed of Miraak, thinking him useless from now on, as he has found a more worthy servant - Dovahkiin. Miraak is then executed by Hermaeus Mora. The crisis at Solstheim has been lifted. Mission accomplished!

### 110 - 🙌
Miraak has surrendered. Dovahkiin wants Miraak to live. Therefore, he shouts "Bend Will" multiple times at Miraak. The Thu'um has taken effect and transformed Miraak into a mindless and obedient servant of Dovahkiin. No one will threaten Solstheim from now on. Mission accomplished!

### 150 - ❌
Dovahkiin has fallen. Mission Failed.

(The outcome is selected by Miraak)

Outcome 1:
Miraak summons the venom tentacles and wraps Dovahkiin. With screaming echoing in the arena, Dovahkiin perishes with excessive agony. No one can stop Miraak anymore from his evil plan to conquer and corrupt Solstheim.

Outcome 2:
Miraak inflicts "Bend Will" shout to Dovahkiin. Wounded and exhausted, Dovahkiin cannot resist such a powerful Thu'um. Quickly, he turns into a mindless paw, a forever loyal servant to Miraak. With the evil Dovahkiin joining forces, Miraak becomes unstoppable more than ever before. The people of Solstheim have to prepare for their doom.
