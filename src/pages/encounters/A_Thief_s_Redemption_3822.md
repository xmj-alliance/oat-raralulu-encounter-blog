## Stages

### 10 - Solitude
This is the first time that Lucien visits Skyrim to pursue his Dwemer research.

Unfortunately, due to the unfamiliarity of the Skyrim customs and culture, he was robbed by a group of bandits on his way to Solitude.

Depressed, without a single Septim left, he wandered on the street of Solitude, not sure what to do. It is where he met Inigo, a street thief at that time.

Inigo was up to something and hiding behind him in the corner, but eventually noticed by Lucien.

After a few lines of dialog exchange, Inigo feels great sympathy for Lucien, and for the first time, he decides to help a stranger in desperation.

### 20 - Solitude
Inigo decides to help Lucien deal with the Bandits and help him get his belongings back. He asks Lucien for the location of the robbery and the appearance of a bandit he can remember. They start questioning tavern patrons, guards, or other street dwellers for more information about this bandit gang.

### 30 - Solitude
Inigo believes they are faced with the bandits living at The Ebon Cave. It is impossible for them to slaughter bandits along the way while making big noises since they are outnumbered by them. They need to plan their infiltration carefully. They make the choice to either sneak in and sneak out without hurting anyone, or eliminate the bandits quietly when they have the chance. 

### 40 - The Ebon Cave
Lucien follows Inigo to sneak into The Ebon Cave. Done checking the layout, Inigo believes Lucien's belongings are stored in the chest at the Master chamber guarded by the bandit leader. They must avoid the bandit's detection at all times since they cannot win an open conflict with a whole gang of bandits.

### 50 - The Ebon Cave
(Improvise on the situation of the bandit leader) The bandit leader has been dealt with. Lucien and Inigo have the items in hand. They need to find a way out.

### üôå 100 - The Ebon Cave
Lucien and Inigo have escaped The Ebon Cave carrying Lucien's belongings. Mission accomplished.

Lucien offers to pay Inigo to be his bodyguard protecting his research. Lucien does not wish to see Inigo's talent wasted by continuing to live as a street thief.

### ‚ùå 110 - The Ebon Cave
Lucien or Inigo has fallen at The Ebon Cave. Mission failed.
